Dear DatASci,
I write to ask you for your input in developing a group response to these recent events.
Overnight on Thursday, April 4, DataCamp released a statement in their official blog that you can find here: https://www.datacamp.com/community/blog/note-to-our-community. To summarize, in October of 2017, an executive at the company sexually harassed an employee at a company social event.</description>
