      <description>Today, I hope to present a quick glimpse at the phenomenon called the “Curse of Dimensionality”. For this demonstration, I am simply calculating how much random data stays within two standard deviations (in the Euclidean norm) as we go from one dimension to higher dimensions.
Random DataHere are 10 vectors of 100 random numbers each sampled from the standard normal distribution stored as a matrix …
X &amp;lt;- matrix(rnorm(1000), nrow = 100, ncol = 10)… and as a data frame.</description>

      <description>Today I finally read a tutorial on gganimate, and here I will build my first example. My hope is to eventually simulate traversal on a directed graph.
library(tidyverse)library(gganimate)Create Node DataFor this example, I will have 3 nodes (located at 3 vertices of a triangle), 100 dots distributed among the nodes, and a new placement over 21 states in time.
N &amp;lt;- 100 # number of dotsT &amp;lt;- 20 # number of iterationsnode_names &amp;lt;- c(&amp;quot;Node 1&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Node 2&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Node 3&amp;quot;)iter &amp;lt;- rep(0, N)node &amp;lt;- rep(&amp;quot;Node 1&amp;quot;, N)x &amp;lt;- 10 + rnorm(N, 0, 2)y &amp;lt;- 20 + rnorm(N, 0, 2)states &amp;lt;- data.</description>

      <description>IntroductionFollowing up on Rachel Wellford’s tweet about Senate votes for Supreme Court confirmations, I decided to try to graph the data. Below, I have
a ggplot picture with decent labelinga searchable datatablea plotly interactive graphThe data came from Senate.gov. I chose to focus on 1967 onward because it appeared that voting procedures were slightly different before Thurgood Marshall’s nomination process.</description>

      <description>ProblemThe question that one of my teaching assistants posed was “What is the difference between lm(y ~ x) and lm(y ~ (poly,1)) for linear regression in R?” That is, it is quickly apparent that those commands produce different results, but for the same intention. Here I will try to explore the underlying difference.
Disclaimer: I know that the following discussion is incomplete. These are simply notes that I threw together overnight.</description>

      <description>Thanks to Dr. Elaine McVey’s course at DataCamp, I feel that I can convert my Data Science course’s lab assignments and slides to flexdashboard. Today, I converted the first lab assignment. The hope is that the students can clearly see the instructions that I am trying to convey rather than facing a wall of text.

      <description>As a lecturer at UC Merced, each semester I find myself needing to figure out how many days I get to teach. Furthermore, I like to plan out my lecture schedule down to the days themselves. Here I hope to use some R code to quickly figure out (say) which days are on Tuesday or Thursday.
ConstructionIn R, the seq command can be used with dates easily.

Well, I hope to delete the pre-included widgets for now since I do not have publications.</description>

      <description>Homepage widgets display as sections on the homepage. They can be enabled/disabled and configured as desired. Academic has the following widgets available to use:
 About/biography Selected publications Recent publications Recent news/blog posts Projects Selected talks Recent talks Contact Tag cloud Hero (introduction) Custom widget (demonstrated with the teaching example)  The example site that you copied to create your site uses all the different types of widget (except talks), so you can generally just delete the widgets you don&amp;rsquo;t need and customize the parameters of the widgets you wish to keep.</description>

I cloned/downloaded Academic but Hugo produces errors when using it with my existing Hugo site
Academic is a website framework rather than just a theme. Therefore, you must follow the full installation guide found on the Demo/Documentation website or in the Github Readme. If you still have problems, first try running Hugo on the Academic Example Site found in the themes/academic/exampleSite folder and then compare the configuration parameters in the Example Site&amp;rsquo;s config.</description>

      <description>Here are a few tips for migrating an existing website from Jekyll to Hugo. These tips can be applied in conjunction with following Hugo Academic&amp;rsquo;s getting started guide.
Move static content to static Jekyll has a rule that any directory not starting with _ will be copied as-is to the _site output. Hugo keeps all static content under static. You should therefore move it all there. With Jekyll, something that looked like</description>
