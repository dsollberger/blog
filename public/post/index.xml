      <description>If you are planning to do the R assignments on your own computer (recommended), then here is a quick outline for obtaining the software.
There are two separate software programs. Most people find it easier to use RStudio. than just R, but you need to install R first before installing RStudio (analogously speaking: you need an cell phone before you can use an cell phone case).If you have R and RStudio from a previous course, you still need to update to the current versions!</description>

      <description>Duolingo, the language learning app, places users in groups of 50 and assigns a league to each user to encourage competition. The leagues are
Bronze, Silver, Gold, Sapphire, Ruby, Emerald, Amethyst, Pearl, Obsidian, and Diamond (in that increasing order)What proportion of Duolingo users are in each league?The rules are
everyone starts in the Bronze Leaguethe top 15 percent of each group gets promoted to the next league up (measured weekly)the bottom 10 percent of each group is related downwardIn this post, I will try out some stochastic processes calculations to answer that question.</description>

For work, I need to take a list of names and try to infer the gender. Here I try an R package on the character names in the TV show Fraiser.

Dear DatASci,
I write to ask you for your input in developing a group response to these recent events.
Overnight on Thursday, April 4, DataCamp released a statement in their official blog that you can find here: https://www.datacamp.com/community/blog/note-to-our-community. To summarize, in October of 2017, an executive at the company sexually harassed an employee at a company social event.</description>

      <description>Today I wanted to see if I could create a slideshow of pictures from the gganatogram package. I wanted to combine them with the gganimate package, but I have not figured out how to get that to work. (In particular, the gganatogram() function seems to return a different list layout than ggplot objects.)

      <description>Today, I hope to present a quick glimpse at the phenomenon called the “Curse of Dimensionality”. For this demonstration, I am simply calculating how much random data stays within two standard deviations (in the Euclidean norm) as we go from one dimension to higher dimensions.
Random DataHere are 10 vectors of 100 random numbers each sampled from the standard normal distribution stored as a matrix …
X &amp;lt;- matrix(rnorm(1000), nrow = 100, ncol = 10)… and as a data frame.</description>

      <description>ProblemThe question that one of my teaching assistants posed was “What is the difference between lm(y ~ x) and lm(y ~ (poly,1)) for linear regression in R?” That is, it is quickly apparent that those commands produce different results, but for the same intention. Here I will try to explore the underlying difference.
