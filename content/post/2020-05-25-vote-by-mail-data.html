<h1>Data</h1>
<p>Today I am going to try to make a choropleth (map + data) of the percentage of registered voters that sent in ballots for the 2018 elections in the USA. I gathered the data from and by the following sites:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/few-states-are-prepared-to-switch-to-voting-by-mail-that-could-make-for-a-messy-election/">Few States Are Prepared To Switch To Voting By Mail. That Could Make For A Messy Election</a> — FiveThirtyEight artcle from April 27, 2020</li>
<li><a href="http://knowledgelink.upenn.edu/admin/guides/HowToCommaList-101612.pdf">How to Create a Comma Separated List from an Excel Column</a> — from University of Pennsylvania</li>
</ul>
<pre class="r"><code>states &lt;- tolower( sort(c(state.name, &quot;District of Columbia&quot;)))
voted2018 &lt;- c(2,5,62,1,54,88,4,3,2,25,4,38,9,6,17,16,10,1,2,18,4,2,15,21,3,6,63,15,6,5,10,36,3,2,NA,13,4,104,3,4,2,15,1,4,89,6,2,92,1,5,22)
vote_data &lt;- data.frame(states, voted2018)</code></pre>
<p>The 538 article’s table caption included the following notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>“It’s not possible to calculate these numbers for North Dakota, as it doesn’t have voter registration. However, it does have a relatively high rate of mail voting — 23 percent of its votes were cast by mail in 2016, and 29 percent in 2018. Republicans control both the governorship and state legislature in North Dakota.”</li>
<li>“When asked how Oregon mailed ballots to 104 percent of voters in 2018, state election officials responded that the EAC number was “off” but did not provide further details."</li>
