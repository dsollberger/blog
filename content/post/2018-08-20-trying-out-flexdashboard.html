<p>Thanks to Dr. Elaine McVey’s course at DataCamp, I feel that I can convert my Data Science course’s lab assignments and slides to <code>flexdashboard</code>. Today, I converted the first lab assignment. The hope is that the students can clearly see the instructions that I am trying to convey rather than facing a wall of text.</p>
<p>To convert my lab, which was previously in an R Markdown document for HTML output, I had to</p>
<ul>
<li>explicitly used <code>echo = TRUE</code> in each code block that should be presented to the student</li>
<li>used the <code>\huge</code> LaTeX font size modifier on math-mode elements</li>
<li>changed the YAML heading to call for <code>output:   flexdashboard::flex_dashboard: orientation: columns</code></li>
</ul>
<p>From there, I also started to arrange the “paragraphs” into separate columns for a nice arrangement.</p>
