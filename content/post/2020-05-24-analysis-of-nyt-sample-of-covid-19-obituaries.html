<h1>Obtaining the Data</h1>
<p>On May 24, 2020, the <em>New York Times</em> published an article called “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/05/24/us/us-coronavirus-deaths-100000.html">An Incalcuable Loss</a>”</p>
<pre><code>&quot;America is fast approaching a grim milestone in the coronavirus outbreak — each figure here represents one of the nearly 100,000 lives lost so far. But a count reveals only so much. Memories, gathered from obituaries across the country, help us to reckon with what was lost.&quot;</code></pre>
<p>What I am trying to do today is summarize the 1001 obituaries.</p>
<p>I started out by manually</p>
<ul>
<li>going to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/05/24/us/us-coronavirus-deaths-100000.html">https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/05/24/us/us-coronavirus-deaths-100000.html</a></li>
<li>right-clicking and selecting “View Source”</li>
<li>copy-and-pasting the HTML code to a text document</li>
<li>paring down the HTML code to focus on the obituaries.</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>&lt;div id=&quot;g-obits&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div id=&quot;g-obit-frame&quot;&gt;
        
            &lt;div id=&quot;g-0&quot; class=&quot;g-obit&quot; data-date=&quot;February 6&quot;&gt;

<h1>Word Cloud</h1>
<p>For one view, I wanted to make a word cloud to reveal the most commonly used words in the one-sentence obituaries. I used the <code>stringr</code> package to extract the text in between the <strong>bold</strong> HTML tags (as well as removing the period).</p>
<pre class="r"><code>obits &lt;- str_extract_all(texts, regex(&quot;(?&lt;=&lt;b&gt;)(.*?)(?=.&lt;/b&gt;)&quot;, multiline = TRUE))</code></pre>
<p>There is <code>R</code> code and packages for making word clouds, but I find it best to use the site <a href="https://www.wordclouds.com/">wordclouds.com</a> since that application has many neat features. Thus, all I needed at this point is to save the results to upload to that site.</p>

<p>Out of curiosity, here I hope to build a boxplot of the ages, but grouped by week of the year.</p>

  mutate(offset = case_when(month == &quot;February&quot; ~ 31,
                            month == &quot;March&quot; ~ 60,
